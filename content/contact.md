### Let's keep in touch!

You can get in touch with me in two ways:

- -> the regular way
- -> the nerdy way

#### The regular way:

Visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciekt/) and let's network there.

#### The nerdy way.

Using the linux terminal: ```$ echo YmFkdWtlckBwcm90b25tYWlsLmNoCgo= | base64 -d```
