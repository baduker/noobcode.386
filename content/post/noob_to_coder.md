## First couple lines of code

The first time I typed some code was when I was 15. It was a simple unit conversion app written in Delphi (Object Pascal). It was a silly (and buggy) thing but becasue it had a proper GUI it felt like the real thing. But GUIs are for noobs, so I switched to the corner stone of programming - the **C** and **C++** duo - only to give it all up and pursue other interests. And that was a real noob thing to do!

Truth be told, I hit a wall learning **C++** and I didn't really believe in myself enough to get past this block.

## Coding rediscovered

Years went by. In 2018, I stumbled upon ["Learning Python"](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-5th-Mark-Lutz-dp-1449355730/dp/1449355730/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1589885333) by Mark Lutz. I picked it up and got totally hooked up. I started devauering books and tutorials on Python and within two weeks I had [my first web scraper](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/189810/comic-image-web-scraper) literally crawling (it was really slow) a favorite comic site of mine.

It had a terrible design, a lot of bad code, and it operated at a snail pace but I was proud of myself because, well, it worked and I wrote it.

I was a coder. Sort of.

## In search of lost time

I ended up writing a bunch of crawlers and scrapers among other trivial scripts, mostly for my own enjoyment and the feeling of being 15 again. However, burning midnight oil over Python wasn't exactly translating into tangible benefits in my regular job, as I was teaching English as a second language.

Also, I felt like I'd lost so much time that I was never going to make it up. Plus, you've got to be born for programming, right. This is how most professional coders come to be. I already had an impostor syndrome, although I didn't even know the term back then.

Don't get me wrong, I liked teaching but at that time it felt like a dead-end job. No chances for promotion, lack of workshops and training, and the salary was highly volatile.

It all sucked.

I wanted to do something else (coding) but I didn't know how to go about it.

## What are clouds made of?

Some more time passed, as I was dabbling in Python and toying with the idea of quitting my job. One day, I saw a comic strip in which a kid asks his dad what clouds are made of. The kid's old man, being an IT dude, I presume, answered - mostly Linux servers. 

Silly, I know, but this dad-joke got me thinking about the cloud (I knew nothing about it at that time) and kindled my inner, smoldering programming fire. 

Being a reader, I got myself a book about AWS. At first, it all was a mambo jumbo, but as I was wrapping my head around the cloud, I realized (in a cliche way) that I really like this computer stuff (cloud or no cloud) and if I don't give it a try, I won't find out what it's like.

Yup, that's how it all started. Weird, I know, but the whole cloud thing pushed me towards becoming a programmer. Or at least trying to find out what it's like to be one.

## Fast-forward to now

I quit my teaching job. By day, I was pursuing my dreams, which, looking at my resume, might be called a (brief) period of job jumping. By night, I was programming and learning about the cloud.

All I knew was that I wanted to be in the Tech Industry. I started out as a Junior IT Project Manager in a FinTech multinational, then drifted towards a Python Tech Support role, to finally landing myself a junior programming position in a small software house.

## What next?

I view myself a tech-savvy, curious, and ambitious individual that enjoys learning all sorts of things and welcomes a challenge. So, I want to continue programming in Python while learning Go(lang) and getting certified by AWS.

Once these are done, I want to go and see the Easter Island.
