## The first paragraph

On this day, [baduker](https://github.com/baduker) crawled out of the tar pit of non-existance and with a handful of terminal commands carved out a pixel of the Web universe and established himself on this modest retro-looking website.

Here you can:

1. read about his [quests](/quests)
2. check out baduker's [configuration](/configuration)
3. and if you feel like it, [drop him a line](/drop_me_a_line)

Other than that, there's not much here. It's just a simple, first blog post. Ever.

The portfolio lives [here](https://github.com/baduker) (for now). For networking, follow the yellow link at the bottom that starts with the letter ```L```.
