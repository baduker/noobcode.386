## About me

This isn't a simple question.

## About the site

N00bCode.info is built entierely with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and it's hosted on [amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

##### What's Hugo?

Hugo, written in Go, is the world's fastest framework for building websites. Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.


##### The 386 look

The theme was created by [Max le Fou](https://gitlab.com/maxlefou/hugo.386) and fine tuned by me.
