## About me

My name's Maciek but on the Web I usually go by the nickname **baduker**. I'm a self-thought Python programmer and a (fresh) [Go(lang)](https://golang.org) enthusiast.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading - mostly novels. A game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) or chess is fine too. I like the outdoors too. Running and going for long walks with my dog makes me feel good.

I'd like to try horse ridding and some woodworking so I could build myself a bookshelf.

If you're interested how I got myself into coding, read [this](/post/noob_to_coder) post.

## About the site

NoobCode.info is built entierely with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and it's hosted on [amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

##### What's Hugo?

Hugo, written in Go, is the world's fastest framework for building websites. Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

##### The 386 look

The theme was created by [JM Fergeau](https://jmf-portfolio.netlify.com) and fine tuned by me.
