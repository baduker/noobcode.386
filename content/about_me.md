## About me

Some really cool stuff about me coming soon!

## About the site

N00bCode.info is built entierely with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and it's hosted on [amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

##### What's Hugo?

Hugo, written in Go, is the world's fastest framework for building websites. Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.


##### The 386 look

The theme was created by [JM Fergeau](https://jmf-portfolio.netlify.com) and fine tuned by me.
